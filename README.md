# GridMethod.jl: Grid Method in Numerical Real Algebraic Geometry

This is a project aiming at implementing the Grid Method theoretically developed by BÃ¼rgisser, Cucker, Krick, Lairez, Malajovich, Shub, Tonelli-Cueto and Wschebor. The aim of this project is to develop parallelizable algorithms for solving real polynomial systems and computing the topology of real algebraic and semialgebraic sets...
